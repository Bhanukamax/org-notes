* Another way to think about is having "motins" and "actions".
** Motions: eg:
- w - move onoe word forward
- b - move to the beging of the word
- and h,j,k,l, etc

** Actions: eg:
- d - delete
- e - edit

** then you can combined them to make more motions:
- dw - deletet word
- db - delete to the begining of word
- ew - edit word

** Prepositions
- i - inside
- a - around

** And with prepositions:
- diw - delete inside word
- eiw - edti inside word
- ei( - edit inside parans
- ei{ - edit insde curly brace
- eit - edit inside tags
- the list goes on :)

** inside vs around (i,a)
- ei( - edit inside parans -> delete the content inside the parans and put you to insert mode
- ea( - edit arond parans -> delete the content and the parans and then put you to insert mode

** delete vs edit (d,e)
- di( - Delete inside parans -> delete the content inside parans but keeps you in nomral mode
- ei( - Edit inside parans -> delete the content inside parans and puts you to insert mode

** there are more motions though, like,
- f - find char
- F - find char backwords
- (then , ; to go back and forth them)
- 0 - go to the beining of line
- $ - go to the end of line
