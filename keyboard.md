I think that's a topic for another blog post :)
    But the short answer is i never had to go from a full size keyboard to these so it wasn't that had like it look like. I took incremental steps and it took me about 6 months to do so. 
    How I did it was I bought this keyboard called the `plank` (which is also open source) but I boughtt it from this vendor called `ZSA` (for 245 Dollars, trust me! :) ). 
    - And it took me like 3 weeks to get back to my spead on the plank:
    --  plank is a 40% so no more dedicated Function keys, Number keys, Tild, etc
    - And from plank I tried to gradually remove keys, columns of keys and my aim was to get to the 34 key `Sweep` layout.
    - It took me like 4 months from getting the plank to get to the 36 Key layout (3rd photo)
    - and it took like another 2 months to drop the two additional pinkey keys on the bottom row.
    - and finally I made it to 34 keys and by the time I built this keyboard I was already doing good on this layout.

And I also regarding speed, I don't type really that fast, I average at about 50 wpm these days, and I'm happy at that speed, I was definitly faster on keyboard with more keys, but it's more about comfort now. With a 32 key layout, all my fingures only have to travel 3 keys at the max (except for the ring fingers, they get 6 each)

And I didn't buy the plank thinking to transition to this keyboard, I baught it thinking I'll use it for some time and later I'll buy a split keyboard like the Ergodox or Kenisis Advantage. But I just happen to notice the Ferris Sweep as soon as the plank arrived :) 

And this is already becoming a mini blog post :), so I'll shut up and will share if I actually end up writing the full story :) 

And as soon as the `plank` arrived I saw this other keyboard called `Ferrise Sweep` (which I use now), and I tried to remove keys from `plank` and do the `Sweep` layout the day one, and it terribly failed. So I went back to

I think that's a topic for another blog post :) I'll try to give the shortest answer possible :)

Short answer is: I never had to go from a full size keyboard to this.
Summary of my keyboard journey so far:
- Used full size keyboard from the begining of time
- Then normal Keyboard without dedicated num pads for few years.
- 60% mechanical keyboard (gk61, non dedicated tild key and arrow keys) - 1 year (no speed effect)
- 40% mechanical keyboard (ZSA Plank) - 3 months (tool like 1 to 2 months to get back speed)
- saw 32 key ferrise sweep on you tube and wanted to try that.
: My master plan: (remove keys from plank until I go down to 32 key split layout, so I can finally build and use a `sweep` :) )
- started stripping keys off the ZSA plank to try to hit get down to 32 keys - took about 3 more months - speed drops during this time was not very dramatic, because it was like removing one key at a time, so had very slight speed drops and came back up like in few days.
- then buit the sweep (I was already in my normal speed by this time)

These days my average speed is around 50 wpm, it used to be around 60 when I was using boards with more keys, but now I optimize for comfort than the speed.
I think I have a mini blog post already :)
