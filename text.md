Hi joy,

This is to request for my income tax to be deducted and paid from the company on my behalf.
Also, since I have already got paid for 3 months already, I'd like to knonw what we can do to solve that? if that can be fixed by deductig from  the next month please let me know what the amount will be, etc.


Hi Reinout.

Past two weeks:
* I have moved commmon UI components from Servedup Lite to Bassline, and added them back to both Pickup and Servedup Lite.

* Finalized local cache implementation started by Nick - in Servedup Lite
    * With this a lot of cart related bugs/ latency issues goes away. We only sync with servdup backend in the payment screen (this is how it's implemented in the servedup menu app too)


- Fixed some issues on the Pickup project:
  - Total amount not showing in the cart when service fee is not available

- Experimented adding progressive web app feature to servedup light
  - This is still not finalized, as I'm not still convinced with the out come

- Started Writing tests on the servedup light project

Right now working on:

- Working on an analytics ticket (again :) ) this is on the pickup project.

Concerns:

- Progress in pickup project
  - I have moved the possible things from servedup lite to pickup, but I'm not sure what's next. I think we are still not ready for implementing the flow after the checkout screen yet.

Priority fo this week:
  - Right now I don't have a clear priority.
  - I'm started on the analytics ticket because that was the only high priority ticket left in the sprint, and Pablo asked about it from me on friday.
