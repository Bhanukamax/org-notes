hi everyone, not sure if this is the right forum to ask this, I'm trying to implement a `tokenizer` with gleam, I checked the gleam lexer, I like that way beause it does not use regex, but not sure if I can do something like that with a pure functional language like `gleam` because there's no mutable state at all, I had a look at `List.fold` too but not sure if that's
doable with it because it has

self ansnwer:
maybe i can use fold and return a uncategorized token for things in between, like

Token(kind: Processing, value: 4)

case token {
 t if t.kind == Processing -> {
    consume_char(t, new_char)
 }

}

Syntax highlighting

is everyone using `emacs` for `gleam` here? I have `gleam-format` working but no syntax highlighting
is there something other than just adding `gleam-mode` and `tree-sitter-mode`, `tree-sitter-langs`
